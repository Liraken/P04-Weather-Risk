## Thesis
This project aims to leverage neural networks and weather data to predict housing risks, enhancing the accuracy of risk assessments amidst escalating extreme weather events. By analyzing historical weather patterns and housing data, including damages and construction details, we'll train a model to forecast weather-related housing vulnerabilities. This research seeks to provide actionable insights for homeowners, insurers, and policymakers, promoting more resilient housing strategies in the face of climate change.
